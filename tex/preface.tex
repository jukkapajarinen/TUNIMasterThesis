This document template is intended to support writing theses in the technical fields in Tampere University. The template is based on the earlier one from the Tampere University of Technology, but it has been updated to use in Tampere University from 2019 onwards. The final output from this template is already an archive compliant PDF/A-1b document, as required for publication of the thesis.

Acknowledgements to those who contributed to the thesis are generally presented in the preface. It is not appropriate to criticize anyone in the preface, even though the preface will not affect your grade. The preface must fit on one page. Add the date, after which you have not made any revisions to the text, at the end of the preface.
