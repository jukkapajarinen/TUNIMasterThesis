  abstract = {Regression testing is the process of retesting the software after it has been modified and ensuring that there is no new errors have been introduced in the software due to these modifications. As the size of the software projects increases, the regression testing became a very costly process, so the need of detecting the faults in the software project as fast as possible became more and more important. Test case prioritization arranges test cases for execution to increase the probability of early fault detection during the regression testing. In this paper, three simple test case prioritization heuristics are presented, where every heuristic calculates the average number faults found per each test case. The three heuristics are combined together to develop a multi-heuristic based algorithm that arrange test cases based on their priorities using the scores obtained from the three heuristics. The effectiveness of the three heuristics and the multi-heuristic based algorithm are illustrated with the help of {APFD} (Average Percentage Faults Detected) metric. The main aim of this paper is to show how using simple heuristics for test cases prioritization would help in error early detection during regression testing, and to show how the proposed multi-heuristic based algorithm has significant increase in terms of {APFD} even if the algorithm is using simple heuristics.},

  title = {Test Case Prioritization Based on Varying Testing Requirement Priorities and Test Case Costs},
  doi = {10.1109/QSIC.2007.4385476},
  abstract = {Test case prioritization is an effective and practical technique in regression testing. It schedules test cases in order of precedence that increases their ability to meet some performance goals, such as code coverage, rate of fault detection. In previous work, the test case prioritization techniques and metrics usually assumed that testing requirement priorities and test case costs are uniform. In this paper, basing on varying testing requirement priorities and test case costs, we present a new, general test case prioritization technique and an associated metric. The case study illustrates that the rate of "units-oftesting-requirement-priority-satisfied- per-unit-test-case-cost" can be increased, and then the testing quality and customer satisfaction can be improved.},
